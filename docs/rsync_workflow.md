# Rsync Workflow

![rsync workflow](img/rsync_workflow.png)

The diagram above shows the rsync workflow supported by Drush `config-merge`.  The rsync workflow is the best mode to use when working with Pantheon, or other systems where it is not possible to run git operations over ssh.  If you have full ssh shell access to the remote site, than you should consider using the  [git workflow](git_workflow.md) instead.
