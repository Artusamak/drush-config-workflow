# Git Workflow

![git workflow](img/git_workflow.png)

The diagram above shows the git workflow supported by Drush `config-merge`.  The git workflow is the best mode to use when you have full ssh access to the remote site, and can run git commands over ssh.  If you are on Pantheon, or are using some other system where this is not possible, then you should use the [rsync workflow](rsync_workflow.md).
